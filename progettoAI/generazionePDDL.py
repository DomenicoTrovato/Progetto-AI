This is a fantasy planning problem.

Below is a Lore Document. Please generate a fully working and syntactically valid PDDL domain and problem definition, suitable for a classical planner like Fast Downward.

You must include:
1. Full :domain definition (with :predicates and :action sections)
2. A separate :problem block with :init and :goal
3. All actions must include :precondition and :effect using correct PDDL syntax
4. Use lowercase and underscores in names
5. The plan must be solvable (at least one valid path to the goal)
